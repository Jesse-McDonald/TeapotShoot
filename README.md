# TeapotShoot
Teapot Shoot is a simple proof of concept network first person shooter client.  While there is a server included for testing, it is an "echo" server that blindly accepts and forwards packets from the clients.

*The game features a teapot for each player that will move and spin as the player does

*A custom binary network protocal for communication betwene players

*Projectiles and colisions for shooting

Future planned features include walls, maps, and textures that can be sent from the server to the players
